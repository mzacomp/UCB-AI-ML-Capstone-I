### Capstone Project: Heart Disease Diagnosis Prediction

**by Mahsan Zare Asadabadi**

#### Executive summary
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or heart diseases are the leading international cause of human death. According to a report conducted in 2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 18 million people died that year due to CVDs, representing 32% of total deaths. Among them, 85% was caused by heart failure and stroke (1). It is difficult for even physician doctors to diagnose these diseases early and correctly. A total of 25% of people die suddenly without any prior symptoms of heart disease.. The use of machine learning methods can help experts in obtaining valuable input about heart patients and promote early detection.The objective of this capstone project is the early detection of heart diseases by using classification models  and a deep-learning model known as Neural Networks. 


#### Rationale
Precision AI in medicine is a rapidly growing field of AI and machine learning. It is focused on   early detection of diseases and to quantify disease risk through the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This project can be a tool to provide experts with the knowledge of the most effective model to use for early detection for such a prominent disease like heart disease. 



#### Research Question
How do classification models compare with deep learning models to best predict heart disease diagnosis? 



#### Data Sources
I will be using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository(link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). 

#### Methodology
The following data analysis incorporates the following classification and deep learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks. 

#### Results

The best model was the Random Forest model with a test accuracy of 0.63. 

#### Next steps
Next steps include: 
 - more research on hyperparameters for the classification models to improve test accuracy. 
 - create a deep learning model like the Neural Network and a few more classification models
- need to incorporate precision, recall, and f1 scoring since medical classification models typically encounter these measures
